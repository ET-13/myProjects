As an exercise, I wanted to see if I could make a rudimentary derivative calculator in c++. This is it. It works up to simple 4th degree 
polynomials. Some improvements I'd like to make are higher degree polynomials (that part is easy), pi, log and ln functionality. 
Also separately I would like to work on an integration calculator. Hopefully will update this program in the future.
