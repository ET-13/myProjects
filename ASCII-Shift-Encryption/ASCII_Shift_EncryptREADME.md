This is a program based on a challenge from Codewars. You give this program a string which is your message to encrypt, then you give an integer which serves as the shift-modifier. The string gets encrypted into ASCII values, those ASCII values are shifted to the amount specified by your integer and then the whole thing gets returned to you in char-type values. Pretty cool toy encryption program. Had fun figuring this one out in C++.
