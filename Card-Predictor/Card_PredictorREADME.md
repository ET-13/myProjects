# Card_Predictor

Made a simple program to deal a card from a standard deck and then have the computer guess what card you got. It displays the results in terminal then gives
you a long-term graph of each attempt number and guess in a plot out of 50. In the future I'd like to play with this more and not use the random module for the
prediction but instead try out different algorithms and similarly plot the data. Maybe deal more than one card as well.
