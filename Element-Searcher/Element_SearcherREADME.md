This is an element searcher that makes an array of a size specified by the user and then finds a given element also specified by the user.
Very funny algorithm based on the idea of dividing the array length into sections and then going in reverse-order on iteration until the target element is found.

Sometimes it works incredibly fast and other times it works worse than a linear search! Play around to see what I mean.
I'd like to add more basic search algorithms in the future. Love using C++ for this stuff.
