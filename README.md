Rather than having all of these exist on separate Repo's I've consolidated them here. These are small-medium sized programs
that range from algorithm implementations, data searchers, math stuff and anything else that I've found interesting enough to 
code just for the fun of it or for the exercise of it. If I'm posting something on any given day it's probably to this repo.
